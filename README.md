# ShiTwit
I already know it's a dumb name It's also a dumb bot and It's already been done like a hundred times so ??????????

# FAQ
These aren't really frequently asked, but these would be FAQs if people knew this existed I bet.

### What is this thing?
It's a Twitter bot that pulls the top posts from r/me_irl & r/DankMemes every hour and tweets them out. Original amirite????

### Why did you do this in C#??????????
Because my software engineering professor is making us write a web app in ASP.NET and I've never used C# or Visual Studio before.
I wanted to get acquainted before we bagan the implementation phase, so I just made the first dumb idea that came to mind. It's really
simple and just utilizes some open source API wrappers for twitter and reddit. A third grader could've done better than this.

### Yea, okay, but C#/.NET is, like, the worst option for something like this? Just use python you asshole?
That's fair

### Can I use it?
I don't care? Just open it in VS, install LINQToTwitter and RedditSharp from NuGet, and add your api details to the AppConfig and BotWebAgent constructor. EZPZ.
